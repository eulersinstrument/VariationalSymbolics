# VariationalSymbolics
Symbolic computation framework for a variety of paradigms in variational mechanics. Currently, this provides a framework for deriving the equations of motion for holonimic n-point mass systems; however, I would like to to add some functionality for non-holonomic systems and frictional forces arrising from the constraints.
